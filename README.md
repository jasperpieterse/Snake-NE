<h4 align="center"> A snake game that learns autonomously using the NEAT algorithm</h4>

This repository contains a **snake game** where the snake learns to navigate its environment **autonomously** using the **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** algorithm.  The snake is controlled by a neural network that evolves over multiple generations through neuroevolution. 

The user can play around themselves with how different inputs (e.g. distance from apple) and outputs (e.g. what direction to move in) influence the learning process of the snake. A detailed explanation of these inputs/outputs and an initial investigation is provided in the attached report.

## Installation 

1. Clone the Repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jasperpieterse/SerpentineSynapses.git
  ```
2. Set Up Python Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
  ```
  Or using conda:
  ```bash
  conda env create --name snake_neat -f environment.yml
  conda activate snake_neat
  ```

3. Install dependencies
  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
This will install the necessary libraries, including:

* **[Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/)** for the game environment
* **[neat-python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python)**: for the NEAT algorithm

## Usage Instructions

The main script can be run via a Jupyter notebook and is configured through the config.py file. The script will run the NEAT algorithm to train a snake to play the game autonomously. The game will be displayed in a Pygame window, showing the snake's progress in real-time.

### NEAT Settings

Modify the following parameters in config.py to adjust the learning process:

- N_RUNS: Number of runs of the NEAT algorithm.
- N_GENERATIONS: Number of generations for each run.
- FITNESS_ITERS: Number of iterations to compute a genome's fitness with in each generation.

Further customization can be done in neat-config.py. Refer to the [NEAT documentation](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html) for details.

### Snake Settings

- INPUT_FEATURES: List of features influencing the snake's decision-making process (e.g., 'wall', 'relative_body', 'relative_apple', 'relative_obstacle').
- FRAME_OF_REFERENCE: Choose between 'NSEW' (cardinal directions) or 'SNAKE' (relative to snake's orientation).
- USE_OBSTACLES: Boolean flag indicating whether obstacles should be included in the game environment.
- MAX_TIME_TO_EAT_APPLE: Maximum amount of timesteps the snake has to eat the apple before dying.
- USE_DUMMY_INPUTS: Boolean flag indicating whether to use dummy inputs for the neural network.
- HISTORY_LENGTH: Number of previous moves to remember.

### Input Features

Based on the frame of reference, each feature is in either four directions (North, South, West, East) or three directions (Front, Left, Right).

- Relative Wall: Inverted distances to walls in each direction to fall within the range [0,1].
- Relative Body: Inverted distances of the closest segment of the snake's body in each direction.
- Relative Apple: Inverted distances of the apple's position relative to the snake's head in each direction.
- Relative Obstacle: Inverted distances to obstacle in each direction
- Binary Wall: The presence of walls directly next to the snake's head in each direction (1 for wall, 0 for no wall).
- Binary Body: Binary indicators of segments of the snake's body immediately next to the snake's head in each direction (1 for body, 0 for no body)
- Binary Apple: Binary indicators of the apple's position of apple being present along the axis relative to the snake's head in each direction (1 for apple, 0 for no apple).
- Binary Obstacle: Binary indicators of obstacle immediately next to the snake's head in each direction (1 for obstacle, 0 for no obstacle)
- History: Set amount of nodes representing the previous N moves of the snake using the encoding $1/(N+1)$ for $N = {up:0, down:1, left:2, right:3}$ for the NSEW frame and $N = {forward:0, left:1, right:2}$ for the Snake Frame of reference

## Credits

This project extends the original implementation from [this repository](https://github.com/danielchang2002/5038W_Final) with the following improvements:

-Refactored the code into a class structure, allowing separate instances of the Snake_NE agent to run and compare. Previously, the code used global variables, requiring a full restart for each run and external storing of results for comparisons.
- Flexible and Custom Input Features for the Neural Network (detailed below)
- Flexible frame of reference for the snake orientation (either cardinal directions or relative to the snake's orientation)
- Integration of obstacles in the game environment
